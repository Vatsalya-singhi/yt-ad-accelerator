    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 31-08-2025</p>

    <p>We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how <em>YouTube Ad Accelerator â€” Skip, Mute &amp; Speed Up
            Ads</em> (the "Extension") handles user data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data</strong> such as
        your name, email address, browsing history, or any personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension may store configuration and preference settings (such as ad-skipping options or playback speed)
        using the Chrome <code>chrome.storage</code> API.
        This data is stored locally on your device and is never shared with us or any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Backend API Calls</h2>
    <p>
        To provide functionality, the Extension makes API calls to a third-party server based on the YouTube video
        currently being watched.
        These requests may include technical details about the video (such as the video ID or metadata) but <strong>do
            not contain any personally identifiable information</strong> about the user.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or share any personal data with third parties.
        Any video-related data retrieved via API calls is used solely for enabling the Extensionâ€™s features and is not
        associated with individual users.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
        Interaction with YouTube or other video platforms is limited to the functionality required to skip, mute, or
        speed up ads.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated
        "Last updated" date.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
